# Sound Mandala

Repetitive Music Experience.

This was my first React Native learning project. It's purpose was to create and publish one app on the App Store, so I would have full understanding of the whole process. The app itself is very simple music player, featuring some of my music and photos from Unsplash.

## Getting Started

This app is React Native project, or actually it's using Expo to be exact. What's Expo?

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and Expo (version 36) installed. For more detailed docs about getting start with Expo, please visit https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/

### Installing

Once you have Expo set up, clone this repository and run `yarn` to install all the modules required. Then run `yarn start` to launch to development server. From there you can launch the project in iOS / Android simulator or use your phone for previewing the app.

## Deployment

For building app binary for App Store you should follow instructions on the Expo site. Basically it's as easy as running the command `expo build:ios` (for example) and Expo framework can handle the rest.

## Built With
